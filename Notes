This will be the Starting document that describes Mammoth.

Mammoth is the name of the project.  It is named after the Ski Slope in California (Mammoth Mountain).  
It's NorthEast of Bakersfield, I believe.

A big note:  I will be honest.  Although, I have read about OOP and OOD over the past 30 years, I have
never designed or coded a large project.

All the Object-Oriented features are new to me in practice.  

It's like anything.  We learn a lot on our first project.

This project (the program) is a Productivity Solution.  It is centered around a "Calendar".

Most things will be "Dated" according to creation.  
  Creation Date:
  Activity Date: When is the meeting or event supposed to take place?
